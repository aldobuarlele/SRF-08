# SRF-08

On the demonstration, I'm using 4 SRF-08 with each different address. It looks like the accuracy is good enough for robotic use. the bad side is the delay reading with each  SRF-08 is far too long(70ms), maybe for fast pace robots, they can choose to reduce the range by sending the specific address to SRF-08 according to the datasheet("Changing the Range").
